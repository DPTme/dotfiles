# Greg's Home Directory Dotfiles

This is my personal collection of dotfiles (and some miscellaneous files).

Currently the only information that contains my personal information is the `.gitconfig`, which
has my name, email, and GPG signing key ID.

Feel free to fork this repo and use for your own dotfiles.

## Installation

- If you're not me, you should fork this repo first to make your own personal adjustments.
- Clone the repo somewhere. I always have a `~/git` directory, so I end up cloning to
  `~/git/dotfiles`.
- Run `./install.py`, or `./install.py -f` if you are ok with existing dotfiles being replaced.
